# 3D Space Website

## General Info

#### Motivation
To improve my knowledge of web development, I followed a tutorial to create a 3D website ( Video : https://youtu.be/Q7AOvWpIVHU ). Afterwards, I wanted to continue the project by making a website about the Earth and the Moon.

#### Project Description
The website is divided in two sections: [Earth](https://3-d-space-website.vercel.app/#earth) and [Moon](https://3-d-space-website.vercel.app/#moon).
Each section contains information about the subject, and the background shows an ideal of what it might look like in reality.
